### Description

10 healthy human volun- teers were recruited and randomized to receive one in four different antibiotic courses or to be a control. Before, during, and after 
exposure to antibiotics, they provided a total of six stool samples. Four antibiotics were selected based on their clinical relevance and broad-spectrum activity against 
Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative organisms.

Four antibiotics from different chemical and therapeutic classes were used: ciprofloxacin (quinolone class), cefuroxime (Î²-lactam class), doxycycline (tetracycline class), 
and azithromycin (macrolide class). As a control, stool samples from two untreated healthy individuals also were processed.

They have very nicely uploaded a file for their analysis:

The file sample.RData has the sample information.
I converted that into a tsv as Kang_Sampling_Info.txt
